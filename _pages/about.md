I am a second year master's student at the [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. Rui Jiang](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1111/1526.htm).

Previously, I finished my bachelor degree in [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

My research interests fall in Natural Language Processing.
